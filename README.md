# Tracking NLP resources for Arabic üöÄ

This project aims to track Natural Language Processing (NLP) resources for the Arabic language and gives an overview
of the state-of-the-art (SOTA) across the most common NLP tasks and their corresponding datasets.

The idea is to track papers, datasets, pre-trained models and SOTA of each NLP task. This inventory is built with **business applications** in mind, the objective being to have a starting point for NLP based solutions, rather than fully focused on research.

The main goal is to provide the reader with an overview of benchmark datasets and the state-of-the-art for their
task of interest, which helps building a quick proof of concept (POC) for their target application. 

## NLP tasks

- [Automatic speech recognition](automatic_speech_recognition/index.md)
- [Speaker Diarization](diarization/index.md)
- [Machine translation](machine_translation/index.md)
- [Question answering](question_answering/index.md)
- [Language Modeling](language_modeling/index.md)
- [Diacritization](diacritization/index.md)
