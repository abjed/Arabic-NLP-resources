# Tracking NLP resources for the Arabic language ðŸš€

This project aims to track the progress in Natural Language Processing (NLP) for the Arabic language and give an overview
of the state-of-the-art (SOTA) across the most common NLP tasks and their corresponding datasets.

The idea is to track papers, datasets, pre-trained models and SOTA of each NLP task. 
The goal is to eventually cover both traditional and core NLP tasks such as dependency parsing and part-of-speech tagging
as well as more recent ones such as reading comprehension and natural language inference. The main objective
is to provide the reader with a quick overview of benchmark datasets and the state-of-the-art for their
task of interest, which serves as a stepping stone for further research. To this end, if there is a 
place where results for a task are already published and regularly maintained, such as a public leaderboard,
the reader will be pointed there.
