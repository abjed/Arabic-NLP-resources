## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## How Can I Contribute?

Arabic-NLP-resources is an open source project and we love to receive contributions from our community! There are many ways to contribute: 
* Add more resources to an already documented task : modify the `index.md` file under the folder of the considered task. For example, if you want to add resources on Machine Translation, modify the file [`machine_translation/index.md`](machine_translation/index.md).
* Add resources for a new task : add a new folder with the task's name (replace spaces in the name with `_`) in the root path of the project. Then, add an `index.md` file with the resources to include. 

### Recommendations
* Make sure to follow the configuration of the pre-existing pages. An `index.md` file should have a title, a subtitle for each section (it can be Frameworks, Datasets, Pre-trained models, etc.) and resources should be included in tables with different columns (Date, Name, Publisher, Comments, Data, etc.).
* Though this project holds resources for the Arabic language, feel free to include implementations and frameworks and any resource that is language-independent or includes Arabic among other languages. 
* The goal of this project is to centralize resources and help gather quick information about an NLP task for Arabic for anyone working on research or commercial applications. Any help is much appreciated!
